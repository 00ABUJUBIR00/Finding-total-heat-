HISTORY: This was just a fun little code that I thought would be cool to write.My CSE friends were amazed that i wrote a 200 line code. It was fun for sure, took like 3 hours.

so what this code does is it finds the total heat absorbed by water when it is heated. It will take Initial temperature and final temperature and will ask some questions based on it will ask some questions like is the water frozen or maybe is the water boiling etc
this can help students to prctice and find the correct answers.
for those who want to learn about the code:
At first we take input from user like (mass, initial temperature, final temperature) here we are using [double] as it works  for both integers and fractions. There are some constant like specific heat, Lf anf Lv 
there are sevral terms that we have to take in term
